# Get_Next_Line

Third project at 42 Born2Code school. Reading line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.

Goal: to learn static variables, to gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, and to learn the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer taking into account the unexpected complexity implied in the use of only one static variable.
